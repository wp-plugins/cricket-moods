20050824: Version 1.1.1, 1.0.2
* Bug fix: the 'before' parameter of cm_the_moods() appeared before *every*
  mood instead of just the first one. Thanks to Chinky Jew <chinkyjew@gmail.com>
  for catching that.
* Added HTML comment to admin styles.

20050629: Version 1.1.0
* Modified cm_update_moods to use WP's builtin meta functions.

  already exist) or upgrades the old moods table on plugin activation.
* Modifying documentation to be wp-plugins.org compliant.
